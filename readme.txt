No #1 plugin for Omnibus directive, which will automatically show the lowest product price for the last 30 days, according to the EU law, called Omnibus directive.

Omnibus Lite for WooCommerce plugin will make your WooCommerce store ready for law changes which are introduced with the so-called Omnibus directive.

### What is Omnibus?

The EU Omnibus Directive, introduces changes to four legal acts concerning consumer protection:

1. [The Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0083)
1. [The Price Indications Directive (98/6/EU)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=celex%3A31998L0006)
1. [The Unfair Contract Terms Directive (93/13/EEC)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A31993L0013)
1. [The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (2005/29/EC)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32005L0029)

The goal of the new law is to expand the scope of the existing consumer rights framework. It applies to physical services and goods to cover digital content, goods, and services.

The EU Omnibus Directive is part of the EU’s [New Deal for Consumers initiative](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/consumer-protection-law/review-eu-consumer-law_en), which was created to strengthen the enforcement of EU consumer laws as well as to modernize EU consumer protection rules in light of market developments.
